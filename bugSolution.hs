The issue is resolved by using a more restrictive approach, ensuring the list processing stops at the first odd number. The `filterEven'` function checks for an odd number upfront, and if found, it terminates the computation. This approach avoids the risk of infinite looping.  ```haskell 
filterEven' :: [Integer] -> [Integer] 
filterEven' [] = [] 
filterEven' (x:xs) = if even x then x : filterEven' xs else []
```
